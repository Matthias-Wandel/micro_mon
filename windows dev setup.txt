Set up pico development undder WSL

Takes about 10 gigs

https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/pico-development-using-wsl

Install wsl:
From command line:
	wsl  -- install =d Ubuntu
This installs ubuntu.

Installing the development environment:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install git cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi 
	sudo apt install libnewlib-arm-none-eabi build-essential libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib

Installing the Pico repositories
	cd ~/
	mkdir pico
	cd pico
	git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git --recursive
	git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples.git


in .bashrc. add the following
	export PICO_SDK_PATH=/home/mwandel/pico/pico-sdk
	export PICO_BOARD=pico_w
	export WIFI_SSID="82 starwood"
	export WIFI_PASSWORD=6132266151

Building the examples
	cd ~/pico/pico-examples
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make


Get picotool
	git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool.git
	sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
	cd picotool
	mkdir build

But need libusb.  don't know what pkgconf does, but it made it work.
	sudo apt-get install libusb-dev
	sudo apt install pkgconf
	pkg-config libusb-1.0 --libs --cflags
	
Then build picotool:
	cd ~/pico/picotool
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

But this didn't work due to unable to initialize libUSB.  gave up on that.
But was able to download windows picotool
https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpi-pico-utils/
But unfortuantely this can't force a reboot like the one on the raspberry pi can
This makes it much less useful
