How to set up development environment on a raspberry pi pico

Add the following lines to the end of your .bashrc:
    export PICO_BOARD=pico

For pico_w, add the following:
    export PICO_BOARD=pico_w
    export WIFI_SSID=myssid
    export WIFI_PASSWORD=mypassword
	
After adding these to your .bashrc, logout and log back in to make sure they become active.


# I found this really useful script that is able to st up all the tools and such
# that you need.  I recommend you use this.
Download pico_setup.sh:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup/master/pico_setup.sh
    Change any "mkdir" to "mkdir -p" if you want to re-run the script

chmod +x pico_setup.sh
./pico_setup.sh

If you want to run pico_setup.sh more than once (in case it was interrupted or something
went wrong) edit the micro_setup.sh script to change instances of "mkdir" to "mkdir -p"


Loading code:
	pico/picotool/build will contain "picotool"
	Put this somewhere on your path to make it easy to run.
	To load code (without having to touch the pico):
		sudo picotool load -F my_project.uf2
		
	To reboot the pico after loading code:
	    picotool reboot -F
	

Listen to USB output for debugging:
	Install minicom (sudo apt-get install minicom)
    minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
