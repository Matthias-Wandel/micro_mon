How to set up development environment:

Add the following lines to the end of .bashrc:
    export PICO_BOARD=pico_w
#    export WIFI_SSID=office    --- Not sure where to set these so they actually get used!
#    export WIFI_PASSWORD=6132266151

Download pico_setup.sh:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup/master/pico_setup.sh
    Change any "mkdir" to "mkdir -p" if you want to re-run the script

chmod +x pico_setup.sh
./pico_setup.sh



Skipping some Pico W examples as WIFI_SSID is not defined



Listen to USB output
    cat /dev/ttyACM0
        or
    minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
